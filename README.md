# Juego_Ahorcado
The classic hangman game, now created with javascript, html and css (plus bootstrap 5.3)<br>
*IMPORTANT* You must start a json server to be able to use the game correctly. To do this, use the following command: json-server --watch .[path to]\file_api\file.json<br>
Remember to change "[path to]" to the path of your own directory where you have saved the game
